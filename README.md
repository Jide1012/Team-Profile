# Team-Profile

I did this project because as a developer my challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.




Installation: After Installing inquirer I set up my test with engineer, intern, manager, and employee.


Step 2: After setting up the my tests, I used the logic.js file to create all my questions and answers. Then I linked it to my GenerateHTML file.

Step 3: I created GenerateHTML file which was linked to the HTML and CSS file created when all the questions are answered.

Step 4: After Running Node index.js and answering the questions asked an HTML and CSS file will be created.
